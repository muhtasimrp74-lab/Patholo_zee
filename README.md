## Publish (GitHub Pages — free `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` link)
1. Create an empty repo on github.com (e.g. `pathology-viva`), no README.
2. In this folder: `git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/pathology-viva.git && git push -u origin main`
3. Repo **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**. The included workflow deploys on every push; the link appears in the Actions run and under Settings → Pages.
4. Own domain (optional, bought separately): Settings → Pages → Custom domain, then add the DNS record GitHub shows.

Netlify also works: import the repo, no build command, publish directory `.` (`_headers` adds security headers).

## Editing content
Original 15 topics live in `tools/src/index.base.html`; General Pathology and Haematology are in `tools/content.py`. After editing, run `python3 tools/build.py` to regenerate `index.html`. When you change any site file, bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` so installed copies refresh.
